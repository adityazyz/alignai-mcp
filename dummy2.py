Assalam o Alaikum, sab ko! Hope everyone is doing well. Thanks for being punctual as always. We have a loaded agenda today—product feedback, deployment challenges, onboarding, launch prep, and everyone’s next steps. Sana, let’s get a solid update on the latest testing cycle before we dive in.

Walaikum Assalam, Ali. So, we wrapped up the third beta test with fifty users across Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad. Feedback numbers were very informative. Lahore users appreciated the voice-assist features, but Karachi reports still show wifi dropouts in high-density flats, especially when routines are set for multiple devices. I discussed the slow command issues with Imran, and he’s mapped the backend bottleneck. Imran, do you want to explain your findings?

Sure, Sana. Basically, Node.js backend struggles with concurrent requests under load, which creates queue delays, especially during peak hours. We're considering a migration to a more robust stack or at least optimizing command queue logic this sprint. Our new focus is also on security—after last week’s vulnerability report, we need a patch pushed before launch.

Also, for the mobile app, third-party integrations with Google Home and Alexa sometimes freeze the UI. Sana and I are planning a full review of the integration code base this week. Sana, mujhay tumhari team ki help chahiye hogi for regression on new onboarding flows as well.

Bilkul, new team members ko assign kar dungi for regression. Speaking of onboarding, feedback is clear—users want a much quicker setup. Preferably under 4 minutes instead of the current average of 6–7. I'm designing new onboarding screens. Imran, I’ll forward initial UI drafts for review by tomorrow.

Demo process ki update bhi share karoon? Sales team ko lag raha hai setup complicated hai, especially for retailers. Some customers lose interest halfway if device doesn’t show results quickly. Aur, Bilal, tumhari team ne ka feedback compile kiya for the demo process?

Haan, humari team ne suggest kiya hai ke sales pitch materials and FAQ update honi chahiye—with short, confident scripts so team feels in control. Training sessions should cover updated features. Farah, could you handle the walkthrough video for influencer campaigns? New demo units are also required urgently by retailers in Hyderabad, Quetta, and Peshawar.

Main procurement se urgently follow-up kar lunga. Bilal, tumhare distributors jo remote cities mein hain, un tak demo units ki list bana ke mujhe bhej do by tomorrow. Also, shadowing sessions for onboarding—Bilal, Sana ki team ke sath two reps nominate karo taake logon ka real-time feedback ookar lein.

Done, Bilal, let’s do those shadow sessions next week—Tuesday aur Thursday ki slots share kar dungi. Also, all observation notes will go to Product and Tech for direct UX fixes.

Farah, third-party integration pe ek new release banani hai jisme Google Home, Alexa, aur Urdu voice command ka pilot enabled ho. Sana, tumhari team ko is QA cycle main dalna parega. I want to know if language commands can be prioritized in the sprint.

Works for me. Jaise hi app build ready ho, I’ll schedule new influencer and press previews. Sana, your short onboarding walkthrough is needed for the campaign—can you coordinate with Imran for a product lead video message this Friday?

Absolutely, Friday afternoon best hai. Video script bhi main kal share kar dungi.

Sales content, revised FAQs, and training modules—Farah ki marketing team ke sath review ho jayen Friday noon tak. Demo scripts bhi Bilal tumhare sales leads se approval le lo.

Remember, privacy and data compliance audit is crucial. Imran, product team and marketing ko summary forward kar dena next two days main. Also, sensitive data storage protocols should be reviewed and updated, Imran Sana ke sath ensure kar lo.

Audit doc complete ho chuka hai, main kal tak share kar dunga. Sana, onboarding QA and technical checklists bhi ready ho jayengi.

Ali, ek aur suggestion hai: B2B white-labeling requests ko consider karen? Multiple clients ne interest show kiya hai. Sana, can you draft a feasibility note, even a preliminary one?

Not on this sprint, but can outline feasibility for the next phase. I’ll send initial notes next month.

For external communication, all messaging must be unified, especially for beta testers who are active on social media. Product and tech teams, please help Farah with finalizing a simple FAQ for public queries. Imran, make sure technical points are simplified for customer understanding.

Done, I’ll edit the FAQ draft and send it to Farah by Thursday.

Team, let’s recap and set clear next steps. Imran, please finalize backend upgrades, security patch, regression, and onboarding QA. Sana, handle onboarding flow improvements, demo video, and FAQ with Farah. Bilal, revise sales docs, nominate shadow reps, and collect retailer feedback. Farah, finish competitor analysis, PR pack list, and arrange influencer reviews once videos are ready.

Also, product launch event planning should kick off—tentative launch in three weeks if no critical blockers.

Ali, let’s finalize date next sync.

Agreed. Oh, Farah and Sana, please coordinate media invites and press kits prep simultaneously, so no delays between demo video and campaign kickoff.

On it, will ping creative team tonight for initial press kit drafts.

Sana, user shadowing feedback summary ko ek formal doc me compile kar do—Friday ko team ko present karenge.

All major technical updates and progress will be posted daily on Slack; any critical issues, I’ll flag Ali directly.

Influencer and retailer event shortlist I’ll share by Monday. Shipment plan with PR creative will be finalized as soon as demo video is ready.

Let’s maintain daily momentum. Next team sync Friday, same time. Teamwork aur transparency pe focus rakhein. Bohat shukriya, Allah Hafiz!

Allah Hafiz! Shukriya, team!
